- 👋 Hi, I’m @mrileyclark
- 👀 I’m interested in transitioning from a career in Human Resources to a career as an front end web developer!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about this career path with Codecademy. I will be completing this online career path this week and I am excited to get more hands on practice buildling websites and web applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that will help me improve my knowledge and skills to become an front end web developer.
- 📫 How to reach me on twitter @maryariley4578
